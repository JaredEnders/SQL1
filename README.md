# SQL (Case Assignment)
Part 1: Data Engineering
- I used the information I was given to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
- For the primary keys I checked to see if the column was unique, otherwise I created a composite key
- Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table

Part 2: Data Analysis
- Once I had a completed database, I did the following:
    - Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary
    - Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986
    - Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name
    - Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name
    - Listed first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B"
    - Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
    - Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
    - LAstly, in descending order, I listed the frequency count of employee last names, (i.e. how many employees share each last name)
